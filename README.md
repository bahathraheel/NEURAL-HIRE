## ✨ What is Elite-hire?

Elite-hire combines the judgment of a **top-tier executive search partner**, a **behavioural psychologist**, and a **data scientist** into a single intelligent recruitment engine. It processes Job Descriptions and candidate profiles through a rigorous **6-phase analysis pipeline** to deliver ranked, bias-free hiring intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Phase 0 — Bias Audit
- 🔍 Detects **proxy bias** (credential inflation, prestige proxies)
- 🚫 Flags **gender-coded language** ("rockstar", "ninja", "crushing it")
- 📅 Catches **age proxy** language ("digital native", "recent graduate")
- 📋 Identifies **scope creep** (>12 requirements for mid-level roles)
- 🛡️ Removes candidate name, school, and address from scoring context
- 📊 **Self-Correction** — If bias is detected, candidate data is auto-redacted andJD is flagged before the analysis engine runs.

### Phase 1 — Job Deconstruction
- 🎯 **Role Intent** — What problem does this hire solve?
- 📊 **True Seniority** — Inferred from scope, not inflated title
- 🔒 **Hard Gates** — Non-negotiable qualifications listed explicitly
- 🌊 **Soft Texture** — Culture, pace, autonomy level
- 🔍 **Tacit Skills** — What the JD doesn't say but clearly needs
- 🏆 **Success Archetype** — Ideal candidate's career shape in 2 sentences

### Phase 2 — 7-Signal Extraction

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **A** — Semantic DNA | 30% | Conceptual overlap between career corpus and role intent |
| **B** — Career Trajectory Arc | 22% | Velocity, pivot quality, progression depth, tenure context |
| **C** — Behavioral Pulse | 18% | Activity recency, engagement depth, open-to-work signals |
| **D** — Hard Criteria Match | 15% | Binary gate check + partial credit for near-matches |
| **E** — Predictive Churn Score | −10 if HIGH | 18-month retention probability estimate |
| **F** — Team Chemistry Index | +8 if ≥8/10 | Skill gap fill + cognitive diversity + friction risk |
| **G** — Explainability Confidence | Modulates band | Data completeness rating (1–5 stars) |

### Phase 3 — Composite FitScore
```
FitScore = (0.30×A) + (0.22×B) + (0.18×C) + (0.15×D) + ChurnPenalty + ChemBonus
```
- Scale: 0–100
- Confidence band derived from data completeness
- Hard fail on gates = candidate removed with reason stated clearly

### Phase 4 — Ranked Shortlist + Hire Briefs
Each shortlisted candidate receives a full **Hire Brief**:
- 📝 One-line thesis a CEO would remember
- 💪 Top 3 signal strengths with evidence citations
- ⚠️ Primary risk — direct, not diplomatic
- 🔎 Second opinion flag (if confidence band >±8pts)
- 📬 Personalised outreach angle
- 🎯 Hypothesis-testing interview probe
- 🔢 Plain-English explainability trail

### Phase 5 — Counterfactual Pipeline
For every candidate scoring 50–65 ("near-misses"):
- **Current Gap** — The single biggest reason they didn't shortlist
- **One Change Away** — Specific experience or signal that would move them to top tier
- **Pipeline Action** → Keep warm / Refer to alternate role / Close the gap first

### Phase 6 — Adaptive Re-Ranking
- Rate candidates 👍 / 👎 to shift signal weights in real time
- 👍 → strongest signal weight +3%
- 👎 → weakest signal weight −3%
- After 3+ ratings → updated formula stated transparently before rescoring
- ±9% cap — no single signal shifts more than 9% from baseline

### 🔒 Firebase Authentication & Security
- **Secure Access Guard** — Blocks workspace views until authenticated.
- **Manual Login/Register** — Secure Email & Password login slot.
- **Google Sign-In** — Integrated popup OAuth branding flow.
- **Active Session Profiling** — User initials profile chip and functional Sign Out menu.

### 🎨 Premium Visual Aesthetics
- **Floral White & Pale Brown Styling** — A warm, high-end editorial palette featuring soft `#fffaf0` backdrops and deep `#3e2723` brown typography.
- **Interactive 3D Evaluation Core** — An interactive concentric orbital graphic that tilts in three-dimensional space following mouse coordinates.
- **Typing Slogan Banner** — Uses `TextType` (GSAP-powered) to cycle slogan sequences on load.

## 🔑 Ranking Principles

- ✅ **Never rank by prestige proxies** — brand names and school tiers don't score
- 📈 **Trajectory beats snapshot** — 78 with upward arc outranks 80 at plateau
- 🕐 **Recency matters** — 5-year-old achievements worth ~60% of equivalent recent ones
- 🏗️ **Context multiplier** — same achievement in resource-constrained env scores 1.2×
- ⚠️ **Churn risk is first-class** — not a footnote
- 🌍 **Diversity flag** — homogeneous top-5 shortlists trigger an alert
